      "interpretation": "The project currently sits on a solid, well-managed foundation: practical competence, reliable resources, and steady leadership are its main strengths. What’s pushing it forward is discipline, clear budgeting, and strong relationships with stakeholders or supporters that provide stability and credibility. Immediate opportunities include scaling responsibly and securing further investment, while vulnerabilities include a tendency toward conservatism or resistance to risky innovation that could slow adaptation."

      "name": "Knight of Swords",
      "interpretation": "Over the next six months the project is likely to move quickly and assertively, propelled by decisive actions, new initiatives, or an aggressive outreach push. Key influences will be momentum, clear objectives, and a willingness to cut through obstacles, but obstacles may include haste, overlooked details, or friction from pushing too fast. Practical steps to support positive growth are to channel that energy into focused campaigns, set checkpoints to catch errors early, and manage communications to avoid unnecessary conflict; watch for signs of burnout, scope creep, or shortcuts that compromise quality."
    }
  ],
  "synthesis": "Together the cards show a complementary but potentially tense dynamic: the King of Pentacles supplies the steady resources, governance, and credibility, while the Knight of Swords brings fast-moving ambition and the will to push the project forward quickly. The likely trajectory is a period of rapid progress built on an otherwise stable base — a good recipe for meaningful development if managed carefully. The main challenge will be balancing speed with the King’s standards: use the project’s reliable structure to channel the Knight’s momentum without sacrificing quality, relationships, or long-term viability.",
  "advice": "Honor the King’s systems while letting the Knight act: set clear, short-term milestones and review gates so fast moves are vetted before they scale. Communicate expectations and delegate authority to trusted people to keep momentum sustainable, and pause when you notice rushing, overlooked details, or team friction."

Explanation:
Core Fool symbolism: upright, the Fool embodies curiosity, openness to experience, and a willingness to leap into the unknown (the little bundle, the white rose, the dog/companion, the cliff edge). Those images point to spontaneity and a beginner’s trust.
